#Installing: pip install PyPDF2

from PyPDF2 import PdfWriter

# This is a nice way to iterate using for loops in Python kjjThis is nice but throws

for i in range(0, n): 
    name = input(f"Enter the name of pdf {i + 1}: ")
    pdfs.append(name)

for pdf in pdfs:
    merger.append(pdf)

merger.write("merged-pdf.pdf")
